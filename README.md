# Hotel-Management-System
<h2>About the Project:</h2>
Our hotel management system project was developed during the Advanced Object-Oriented Programming course. It encompasses separate client and admin panels, providing a comprehensive solution for efficient hotel management. The project was inspired by the need to streamline hotel operations and empower hotels to effectively maintain their rooms, services, employees, and tasks. With real-time database support, the system ensures up-to-date information for seamless management. The client panel allows guests to easily check room availability and make reservations. Java was the main programming language used, with JavaFX for the user interface design, and MySQL for the database.
